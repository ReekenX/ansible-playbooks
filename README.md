# Ansible playbooks

My personal (but reusable) migration files from SaltStack (see https://github.com/ReekenX/salt-configs) to Ansible.

# Why to migrate?

I have three main reasons to do so (but in fact there are couple of more):

- Poor SaltStack result output.
- Too complex task dependencies management system.
- Master-slave communication (yes, I know such thing as salt-ssh exists)
