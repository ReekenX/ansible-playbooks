# Ansible playbooks

My personal (but reusable) `Ansible` automation.

Previously I have used `SaltStack` for automation (see https://github.com/ReekenX/salt-configs) but due to many reasons switched to `Ansible`.

# Is Ansible > SaltStack?

No, not really.

I didn't liked very much couple of things in `SaltStack` which made whole deployment-automation unproductive:

- Poor results output.
- Too complex task dependencies management system.
- Master-slave communication (yes, I know such thing as `salt-ssh` exists).

This project has no bugs.

But feel free to file any requests or discuss something by creating a new issue: https://github.com/ReekenX/ansible-playbooks/issues

I normally respond in less than a day. Or just e-mail me (see my profile for e-mail).
